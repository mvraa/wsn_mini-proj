# Mini Project 1
## Project tasks
1. Collect the sensor data, e.g., temperature and light, through a multi-hop network
2. Create sensor data following certain distribution.
3. Send periodic sensor data report or send detected event, e.g., temperature exceeding a threshold
4. The intermediate nodes can perform data aggregation whenever possible
5. Compare with and without data aggregation
6. Data visualization at the sink
7. Real-time data visualization at the sink [Optional]
8. Evaluate the performance of the designed system, e.g., event detection probability, energy efficiency, etc


## Structure




## Progress
### UDP Client and server inspired by contiki-ng example
Tested with the source code from "~/contiki-ng/examples/rpl-udp"

**Howto use:**
1. Compile server code to one mote and client code to another.

2. Only the c files and the makefiles are necessary to compile to the motes.

3. Connect both motes to one PC. ssh into each mote from seperate terminals to vizualise the transactions of each mote on the terminal.
