# Test measurements

These are the real-world test measurements collected from 4 clients, each running on a separate TelosB mote. The nodes were placed near each other and were collecting data at the same time. As a result, the collected data should be both spatially and temporally correlated and therefore useful for conducting aggregation related tests.

Two tests were conducted. A light related test and a humidity and temperature related test.

## Structure
The raw terminal output data can be found in the folder *raw*. The prepped data can be found in the folder *processed* - this is data that has been prepped to be inserted directly into a spreadsheet, and also adjusted to account for offsets due to misaligned starting times during measurement.
