Tested with the source code from "~/contiki-ng/examples/rpl-udp"

Howto:
	Compile server code to one mote and client code to another.

	Only the c files and the makefiles are necessary to compile to the motes.

	Connect both motes to one PC. ssh into each mote from seperate terminals to vizualise the transactions of each mote on the terminal.
